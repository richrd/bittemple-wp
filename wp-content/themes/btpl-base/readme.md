# Bittemple Base Theme

This is my base theme to rule them all.


## Conventions

### TODO's and such

Things that you want to improve but haven't figured out yet should
be marked with comments in the code. Such comments should be prefixed
with `TODO`. That will help finding points of improvement later. 


### This readme

- All headers should have two empty lines above and one empty line below them


### Header

Header templates should use the `<header>` tag as the root element.


### Footer

Footer templates should use the `<footer>` tag as the root element.


### Posts

Post templates should use the `<article>` tag as the root element.
